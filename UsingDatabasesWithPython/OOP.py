#Object Oriented Programming Terminology

#Object - is a bit of self-contained Code and Data.
#Object approach- is to break down the problem into smaller understandable
#parts.
#Examples - String objects, List objects, Dictionary objects,
#Integer objects.

#DEFINITIONS
#Class - a template
#Method/Message - a defined capability of a class .
#Field/Attribute - a bit of data in a class.
#Object/Instance - a particular instance of a class.

#Objects are created, used, and discarded.
#We have special blocks of code (methods) that get called
    ##at the moment of creation(constructor)
    ##at the moment of destruction(destructor)
#constructors are used a lot
#destructor are seldom used

#INHERITANCE

#WE can reuse an existing class and inherit all capabilities of an existing
#class and then add our own little bit to make our new class.

#Another form of store and reuse

#Write once - reuse many timies

#The new class(child) has all the capabilities of the old class(parent)
#- and then some more.
